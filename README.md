# Ch4_Path_Planning
Given the scope of this chapter is limited as an introduction to path planning, the nature of the demonstrated experiment will showcase a centralized framework. In addition, our understanding of offline path planning and the classical methods is extended to multi-robot path planning in series. In this case, the mobile robots tasks / Qgoal is predetermined, and the path-planning method is applied in sequence. However, a more advanced heuristics approach as proposed in “FAULT-DETECTION ON MULTI-ROBOT PATH PLANNING”[10] would be a potential solution to control multiple mobile robots in parallel to their desired Qgoal.

The technical details for this experiment is as follows: We will rely on coppelia-sim as our simulation environment featuring a single “Pioneer 3-DX” as the robot to demonstrate each offline-path planning methods discussed. The next phase will be to feature two “Pioneer 3-DX” as the robot to demonstrate each offline-path planning in sequence. The set environment is featured in Fig 4.12. Each algorithm is programmed in python via Spyder. Therefore, Coppelia Sim is controlled remotely via “Remote API”. For more details check out the Github Repository.
